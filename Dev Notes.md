Setting up my workspace afteer three years. During that time, Node, Dhjango and MySQL all have undergone upgrades. The previous development was with PyCharm and IDEA, while now I am using VSCode. Everything that was working was broken. Each piece needed troubleshooting to make sure it would work properly.

My code is being checked into two separate branches. That too needs to be fixed.

Still need to do end to end testing.

TODOS
- Fix my development environment
- Fix my version control
- Check in scripts and configurations used for development
- Write proper documentation of how to setup the workspace completely
- Document the goals
- Document the roadmap
- Write documentation for the code
