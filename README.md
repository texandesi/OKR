We use OKRs and KPIs to identify and deliver results. The OKRs are managed on spreadsheets that get unwieldy over time. The goal of this app is simple:

- Provide ability to document an objective
- Attach key results to objectives
- Assign owner to the OKR
- Assign KPIs to the results to measure in-flight progress
- Track the OKR over its lifetime using KPIs
- Get feedback on the OKR at every stage
- Provide ability to change the OKR, including adding and deleting.
- This is as simple as it gets.
