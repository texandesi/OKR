# Sample app to learn Angular to build a simple app to track OKRs

This repository is for my work to build a simple OKR app. I am learning Angular 2 and now seems as a good time as any to
open my code to publuc scrutiny.

We use OKRs and KPIs to identify and deliver results. The OKRs are managed on spreadsheets that get unwieldy over time.
The goal of this app is simpe:

- Provide ability to document an objective
- Attach key results to objectives
- Assign owner to the OKR
- Assign KPIs to the results to measure in-flight progress
- Track the OKR over its lifetime using KPIs
- Get feedback on the OKR at every stage
- Provide ability to change the OKR, including adding and deleting.

This is as simple as it gets.
