Fixing the code but already forgot a lot of the syntactic sugar. So not looking forward to fixing this code and adding features.

2024-04-23

Setting up my workspace afteer three years. During that time, Node, Django and MySQL all have undergone upgrades. The previous development was with PyCharm and IDEA, while now I am using VSCode. Everything that was working was broken. Each piece needed troubleshooting to make sure it would work properly.

My code is being checked into two separate branches. That too needs to be fixed.

Still need to do end to end testing.

TODOS
- Write proper documentation of how to setup the workspace completely
- Document the goals (good question. Why have I picked this up after three years)
- Document the roadmap (rise of AI means I need to see if LLMs can be cneaked in somewhere)

Done
- Fix my development environment
- Fix my version control
- Check in scripts and configurations used for development

Software
- github account
- git
- setup a gpg signature to sign code
- VSCode
- Python 3.9 in a venv environment
- Django Framework with CORS, Django REST Framewotk and mysql client
- Angular 2
- bash shell scripts
